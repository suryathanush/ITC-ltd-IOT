CHANGES TO BE MADE
Client side codes :
speed_detect_linked.py : (OCR + publisher code)
(Publisher linked speed_detect.py code)
Line:35 (file path of csv file which is assigned for caching)
Line:14 (client_id = “<any name / or leave as it is>”)

publisher.py : (sample publisher code)
Line:14 (client_id = “<any name / or leave as it is>”)
Line:27 (file path of csv file which is assigned for caching)
Line:96 (main_func())
Place in this function all the image processing script that is supposed to be in the forever loop
Example : if in original OCR code;
                     while(1):
                           print(“hi”)
                           print(“OCR code runs in this loop”)
                          
                         Then main_func() will be like:
                              main_func():
                                    print(“hi”)
                           print(“OCR code runs in this loop”)

Note : arguments in publish() function should be changed according to the return values of OCR code that are to be transfered
